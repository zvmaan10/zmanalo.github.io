            <p>Three. Three decades since this city has seen any real foot traffic from humanity. The only between you and the city is this bridge. The wind feels strong today and the fog is thick and blinding. Your eyes are drying out, and you can't help but blink every second. It’s piercing. The wind is literally pushing you back, yet you’ve managed to keep going.</p>
            <p>A child. You were a child at the beginning of this new era, you have the slightest memory of what a city used to look like. Flashes of your childhood come every now and then. This time it's different. A tremendous urge and desire has overtaken your body. You <strike>want</strike><em><strong>need</strong></em> to see the city. This impulse feels striking, and overwhelming. This is what keeps you going.</p> 
            <p>Exhausted. You haven’t had a proper meal in weeks.You could have collapsed forward, but the wind is almost stopping you from doing so. You have been battling the wind for about 30 minutes now, and at this point the bridge feels neverending. </p> 
            <p>You approach a makeshift barrier made out of buses...</p>
