            <p>“...can’t stop now.”</p>
            <p>You leave the barrier behind and continue moving forward. The echoing screeches of the piercing interrupt your thoughts. It reminds you of a distinct scream. The sound fades as you move further. Your line of sight is only getting more blurry, from your overwhelming thoughts, exhaustion and the heavy fog.</p>
            <p>Suddenly you stop, and accidentally bump into the door of a car. You inspect the bullet holes riddled on this car. About two giant holes on the hood. The windshield has been shattered.You notice the blood left in the car, but there’s no body. You find another bullet hole that pierced the front seat. "Somebody should've died here," you say to yourself.</p> 
            <p>You scavenge the car for whatever remains. “Nothing,” you exclaim. Not even the bullets that rained on this car. After one last attempt to scavenge, you find a piece of crumpled paper under the driver seat. Looks like the registration to this car. “Someone wrote on this.” The ink is pretty faded, but you make out certain words such as, “Don’t” and “Child,” in that order.</p>
