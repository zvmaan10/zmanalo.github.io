            <p>The man from the group of hazmat suits raises a fist, signaling his group to lower their weapons. He looks relieved and yells, “Oh thank you! We’re running low on help. Please tell me there are more coming!”</p>

            <p>You remain dazed and confused. At least it got everyone to lower their weapons, but the other group’s weapons are facing you now. “I…” You’re interrupted by a bullet to your shoulder. “Damn it!”</p>

            <p>The guns on both sides erupt. The city echoes with the sounds of gunfire. You’re hit. You’re in shock. You check to see that the bullet is lodged in your shoulder. Bullets are flying your way and the debris of the concrete barrier is up in the air. You curl up and cover your head with your good arm. </p>

            <p>Adrenaline is fueling your body. Your heart feels like it's going to burst out of your chest. The guns stop. You peek over the barrier to see a pair of the regular people retreating. The suits downed three from the other group, including the woman, presumably, Jude. You can see another woman and the child running off in the distance.</p>

            <p>“Are you hit?” asks a man from the group of suits.
                <br>“Yes!” you reply.
                <br>“How bad?”
                <br>“I’ll live. The bullet is still in my shoulder.”
                <br>“We’ll help but you gotta help us too, we have casualties over here.”</p>
