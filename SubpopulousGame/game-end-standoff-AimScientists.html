          <p>You take aim of the suits. You have the leading person in the suit within your crosshairs. Just as you’re about to pull the trigger, he quickly faces you. You duck back down for cover.</p>

            <p>“SNIPER ON THE BRIDGE!”</p>

            <p>The guns start ringing. The city echoes with the sounds of gunfire. You’re in shock. Bullets are flying your way and the debris of the concrete barrier is up in the air. You curl up and cover your head with your arms.</p> 

            <p>The rain of gunfire comes to an empty sound of it’s echoes. It stopped. You continue to lay down in your cover. It doesn’t sound like anyone survived as the echoes turn silent. You hear something. The wind. It sounds like screams. However, the sound is almost becoming a normal thing to you.</p>



 <h1 class="fade-in">You are the lone survivor...<br>Thanks for playing!</h1>
