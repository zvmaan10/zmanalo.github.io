            <p>You take one deep breath and let your scrambling thoughts regather. “I’ll join you.”</p>
            <p>The woman smiles. "Good choice," she says, "One more fighter for our cause."</p> 
            <p>"We owe you," says another man, "that should be the last of those damn suits. Who knows what they were up to. Anyways, you'll fit right in Cavity."</p>
            <p>"Cavity?" You ask.</p>
            <p>Jude continues to smile and says, "It's the name of our community. We want to fill this empty city. We have plans to rebuild the world too, the right way. Those scientists were only slowing us down."</p>

            <p>You all walk away from the site of the incident. You can't help but look back and shiver. The sounds of gunfire still haunt you. This is it. The city. Did you find what you are looking for?</p>
            <h1 class="fade-in">You survived and joined Cavity<br>Thanks for playing!</h1>
