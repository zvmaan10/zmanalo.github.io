            <p>The man of the suits raises his hand to signal for his group to halt. “Then surrender yourself. Tell your people to…” The man is quickly interrupted by a bullet to his neck. You dash for cover. You weren't expecting any killing so soon into your journey.</p>

            <p>The guns on both sides erupt. The city echoes with the sounds of gunfire. You’re in shock. Bullets are flying your way and the debris of the concrete barrier is up in the air. You curl up and cover your head with your arms.</p>
            <p>The popping sounds come to a halt. Someone yells, “Come out! Now!” Sounds like the woman Jude. You slowly get up with your hands up. “Come closer.” You leave your things behind. Turns out only two of them were armed. One of them was shot dead, so only four of them remain. You’re still in shock and your hearing sounds filtered. Your thoughts are eased by seeing that, the kid was untouched by any of the violence that had just occurred.</p>
            <p>"You’re definitely not one of our people. What do you want?" asks Jude.</p>
            <p>Still in shock, you remain clueless as to what brought you here, and you respond, "I'm not sure..."</p>
            <p>"I saw what you tried to do. You risked your life to help us. For that, I’m temporarily grateful. For now, how 'bout I give you some choices? Join us or leave. Otherwise, you’re just another block in the road.”</p>
