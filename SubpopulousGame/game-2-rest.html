            <p>You weakly utter to yourself, “I have to regain my energy.” You enter the bus. You feel haunted by the sounds of the creaking from the wind strongly blowing on the bus. You take a seat on one of the few chairs left in this bus and close your eyes for what feels like a minute. You take one deep breath. As your mind wanders, not a single memory as to why you needed to enter this city crosses your mind. Frustration begins to fill your body, and you kick an empty, rectangular object.</p> 
            <p>A bullet rolls out of it. It’s a magazine for a gun.</p>
            <p>“I’ve never seen a bullet like this.”</p>
            <p>You discover the empty bullet casings around your chair and find a worn out sniper rifle. You’ve seen these before, but never shot one yourself. It’s damaged, but it seems functional. You wrap the strap of the sniper around your body and walk out of the bus.</p>
