            <p>“I’ll just be on my way.”</p>

            <p>Jude sighs. “For some reason, many people like you are drawn to this city. Maybe they’re chasing their past. Maybe they want to feel things can be normal. Maybe they’re just looking for trouble. Well, like it’s told, ‘No one ever comes back from the city.'”</p>

            <p>Jude aims her weapon. Even with the guns aimed to your head, you’re left with a bit of hope in your body. For some reason you’ve accepted your fate. You think to yourself, “...a child survived in this world.”</p>
