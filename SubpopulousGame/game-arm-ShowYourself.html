            <p>You stand up and show yourself. You drop your things and have your hands raised. Everyone is in plain sight now, including yourself. As you get a better look at the groups, you notice the group of regular people has a child with them. The child looks maybe six or seven. The right words don’t come to mind in your situation. You’re stuck.</p>
            <p>They yell amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>“What the hell is this? Who is that? Were you planning to trick us?! Not a surprise”
                <br>“This person isn't with you?!” 
                <br>“Hell no. Just cause he’s not wearing a plastic suit doesn’t mean he’s not one of you.”
            </p>
            <p>The woman, presumably Jude, asks you, “YOU WORK FOR THESE CLOWNS? WHERE’S YOUR SUIT?”</p>

            <p>“NO!” you reply.</p>

            <p>A member from the suits takes off his mask and asks you clearly, “WHO SENT YOU?”</p>

            <p>You’re baffled. You think, “What does he mean by ‘who sent me’?”</p>

            <p>He turns to Jude and says, “Alright, cut the act, clearly he’s not with us.” The suits raise their guns.</p>

            <p>The others raise their guns as well. Jude cries, “DON’T!”</p>

            <p>What should you do? You’re just a lone survivor, but clearly one of these groups needs help...</p>
