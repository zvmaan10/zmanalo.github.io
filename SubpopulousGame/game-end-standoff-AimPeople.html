            <p>You aim your weapon at the group of the ordinary people.</p>

            <p>“SNIPER!” yells someone from the crowd. You freeze as you try to catch who spotted you. You’re shot in the chest. You lay down behind cover as your blood drips onto the concrete. You can still hear clearly as gunfire is being exchanged. For some reason, your thoughts are a little clearer now. You realized that this world will forever remain uncertain. No one knows if things will get better.</p>

            <p>“NO!” yells another person.</p>

            <p>You’re fading out. But one thing that’s for certain is your acceptance. You’ve accepted your fate. You’ve accepted the consequences. You’ve accepted the world for what it truly is and will forever be, just a series of chances. Unjust. Unfair. Unpredictable.</p>

 <h1 class="fade-in">You paid the price...
     <br>...your journey ends here.<br>Thanks for playing!</h1>
