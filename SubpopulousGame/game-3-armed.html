            <p>“I only have one bullet. Let’s see if I’ll ever need it.”</p>
            <p>You continue to walk for ten more minutes. You’re really beginning to question your intentions. “Why now? After about 30 years of barely surviving, why risk my life now to see what’s at the end of this bridge.”</p>
            <p>The fog seems to be clearing, but the wind is still strong. As buildings and hightowers become a plain sight, you’ve realized you made it to the end of the bridge. You nearly stop to gaze in awe, however your moment is interrupted by a shout.</p>
            <p>“NO! No more negotiating. Leave us be and neither of us will have to partake in any violence.”</p>
            <p>You spot a standoff between two groups a few yards over. The roaring sounds of the wind must’ve drowned out their yells earlier. Their weapons are aimed at each other, with a few rifles on both sides.</p>
